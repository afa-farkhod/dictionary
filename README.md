- `Object Storage` -  is a data storage architecture that stores data in units called objects, which are bundled with metadata and a unique identifier. Object storage is often used to store large amounts of unstructured data, such as photos, videos, email, and sensor data. Object storage is commonly used for backups, archiving, cloud-native applications, big data, and more. 
- `web3signer` - is an open-source remote signing service that allows validators to securely sign blocks and attestations on multiple platforms. Web3Signer can sign on Ethereum1 and 2, and Filecoin. Web3Signer allows a  Validator Client (VC) to outsource the signing of messages to a remote server.
- `CI/CD pipeline` - continuous integration and continuous delivery pipeline, is a series of steps that automate the process of building, testing, and releasing software
- `Blob storage` is a type of cloud storage that stores large amounts of unstructured data in non-hierarchical storage areas. The term "blob" is short for "binary large object". 
- `Synchronous vs Asynchronous` -  Synchronous means happening at the same time, while asynchronous means not happening at the same time. Synchronous operations are performed one at a time, while asynchronous operations can run independently and at the same time. 
- [Fail2Ban](https://siddhivinayak-sk.medium.com/prevent-your-website-from-brute-force-attacks-use-fail2ban-to-block-malicious-clients-92b15b5ae4ec) - a tool for scanning log files, detecting suspicious activity such as too many failed authentication attempts, and blocking potentially malicious IP addresses. This free service helps protect Linux machines from brute forcing and other automated attacks.
- `AVS` - stands for Actively Validated Service in blockchain. AVS is a new concept in crypto-economic security that allows developers to use Ethereum's economic security infrastructure to create new AVSs. EigenLayer is a protocol built on Ethereum that uses restaking to create AVSs.
- `EVM` - The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized computation engine that executes smart contracts on the Ethereum network. It is a crucial component of Ethereum's infrastructure, enabling the execution of code exactly as intended.
- [Pinpoint](https://pinpoint-apm.gitbook.io/pinpoint) - is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java / PHP. Inspired by Dapper, `Pinpoint` provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.
- `Canvas` is a course management system (LMS - Learning Management System) that helps teachers and students with online learning and teaching
- [Digital Nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad) -  people who travel freely while working remotely using technology and the internet.[1] Such people generally have minimal material possessions and work remotely in temporary housing, hotels, cafes, public libraries, co-working spaces, or recreational vehicles, using Wi-Fi, smartphones or mobile hotspots to access the Internet
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) in software development. It allows developers to automate the building, testing and deployment of applications, making the development process more efficient and reliable.
- [Light Node Vs Full Node](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/light-node) - `Light Node` is typically smaller in size and contain only partial information about the network.
- [cast](https://www.raycast.com/merklefruit/foundry-cast-cli) is a command-line tool that is part of Foundry — a development framework for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. It provides a lightweight, efficient way to interact with smart contracts, send transactions and query on-chain data directly from your terminal.
```
# cast is part of Foundry, so you’ll need to install Foundry first:
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# check installation
cast --version
```
